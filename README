Vim-Glean
=========

A simple quick/dirty script which nearly emulates the behaviour of
Sublime Input (https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sublime%20Input)

I am using this extensively for competitive programming in which, i'm
too busy to develop/improve this tool any further.

currently it supports running cpp, c, python.

## python files
keep your input between '# GleanStart' and '# GleanEnd' as comment. the first character(#)
will be stripped off and the rest is sent to the stdin of your python file.

###example python file
```
#!/usr/bin/env python
# GleanStart
#hello input!
#hello input!
# GleanEnd
print repr(raw_input())
print repr(raw_input())
```

###output:
'hello world!'
'hello world!'


## cpp/c files
The lines between '/*GleanStart' and 'GleanEnd*/' will be sent as stdin to a.out

###example python file
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
/*GleanStart
hello input!
GleanEnd*/
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    string str;
    cin >> str;
    cout << str;
return 0;
}
print repr(raw_input())
print repr(raw_input())
```

###output:
hello input!
